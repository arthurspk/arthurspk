<h1> Hi, I'm Arthur üë®üèª‚Äçüíª - @guiadevbrasil </h1>

I'm passionate about technology! I first encountered computers when I was 7 years old, and since then, I've been discovering more about this wonderful field. I love the opportunities technology offers and the idea of making people's lives easier. I dream of traveling the world, sharing my knowledge and gaining new experiences and insights. I believe knowledge is something everyone should have access to, and I'd also like to experience traveling the world for a while while working on my projects.

I have an experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Node.js, with solid experience in building web applications using React and styling frameworks like Chakra UI, Material UI, Shadcn, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, SaSS, Panda CSS, and Gatsby. On the backend, I work with AWS (including Serverless architecture), GraphQL, REST APIs, DynamoDB, MongoDB, SQL, and MySQL. I‚Äôm also comfortable with tools and environments such as Git, Docker, Linux, macOS, Windows, and command-line systems. Additionally, I have experience with WordPress and design tools like Figma.

I have a community called Guia Dev Brazil that helps people in the computing field. Its purpose is to provide free, quality content worldwide and introduce more people to the technology field. The community has several repositories to help and guide people on their development path. I love learning new things, working in groups, and having new experiences. I want to work outside of Brazil, improve my English, and experience new cultures, people, and have new experiences. I'm currently majoring in computer science and cyber defense, and I'm self-studying other content to further my skills.

Let's have a coffee, I'm always open to learn new things and discuss crazy ideas. You can reach me at arthurguiadev@gmail.com

To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life. ‚îÅ The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
